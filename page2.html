              <h2>How can we minimize the impact of computer device disposal on the environment?</h2>
              <li><b>Re-use reduce recycle:</b>Another way we can help is to recycle and reuse. When we are done with the components we should recycle them properly so they don't end up in the wrong places hurting the environment.
